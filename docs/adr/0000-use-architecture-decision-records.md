# 0. Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2025-01-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to document the architectural decisions made on this project to:
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of the system
- Understand the reasoning behind current design choices
- Avoid repeating past discussions

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard to document significant architectural decisions.

The ADRs will follow this format:
- **Title**: Short noun phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder as a result

ADRs will be numbered sequentially and stored in `docs/adr/`.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context preserved
- Onboarding new team members becomes easier
- Decisions can be revisited with full context

**Negative:**
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Additional documentation overhead
