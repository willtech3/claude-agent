# 1. Use Monorepo Structure

Date: 2025-01-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Claude Agent system consists of multiple components:
- A web frontend for user interaction
- A backend API for business logic
- An AI agent that processes tasks
- Infrastructure as code
- Shared types and utilities

We need to decide how to organize these components to maximize:
- Code reusability
- Development velocity
- Deployment flexibility
- Type safety across components

## Decision

We will use a monorepo structure with the following organization:

```
claude-agent/
├── frontend/          # Next.js web application
├── backend/           # FastAPI serverless backend
├── agent/            # Containerized Claude Code agent
├── infrastructure/   # Terraform/CDK for AWS
├── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types and schemas
├── scripts/         # Build and deployment scripts
└── docs/            # Project documentation
```

This structure allows:
- Shared types between frontend and backend via the `shared` package
- Atomic commits across multiple components
- Simplified dependency management
- Consistent tooling and CI/CD

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single source of truth for the entire system
- Easy cross-component refactoring
- Shared TypeScript types ensure type safety
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline
- Better code discoverability
- Atomic changes across components

**Negative:**
- Larger repository size
- Potential for tighter coupling between components
- More complex initial setup
- Requires careful dependency management
- Build times may increase as project grows
