# 2. Technology Stack Selection

Date: 2025-01-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select technologies for each layer of the Claude Agent system that:
- Support rapid development
- Scale efficiently
- Minimize operational overhead
- Have strong community support
- Enable type safety and code quality

Key requirements:
- Static frontend for CDN deployment
- Serverless backend for cost efficiency
- Container support for the AI agent
- Multi-cloud AI provider support

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: Static site generation, React framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **React 18**: Modern UI library with hooks
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework with automatic API documentation
- **Python 3.11+**: Latest stable Python with performance improvements
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0**: Modern ORM with async support

### Agent
- **Claude Code CLI**: Wrapped in Python for rapid POC
- **Python**: Wrapper language for flexibility
- **Docker**: Containerization for isolation and portability

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code
- **AWS CDK**: For complex AWS resources
- **Docker**: Container runtime
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Shared types across frontend/backend
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code formatting and linting
- **Ruff/Black**: Python formatting and linting
- **Jest/Pytest**: Testing frameworks

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Modern, well-supported technologies
- Strong type safety with TypeScript and Pydantic
- Excellent developer experience
- Good performance characteristics
- Easy to hire developers familiar with stack
- Native cloud deployment support

**Negative:**
- Multiple languages (TypeScript/Python) increase complexity
- Next.js static export has some limitations
- FastAPI serverless requires careful optimization
- Wrapper approach for agent is temporary solution
